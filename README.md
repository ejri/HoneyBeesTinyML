# HoneyBeesTinyML
We're looking into using TensorFlow Lite Micro (TinyML) on an embedded device for monitoring honey bees' conditions and health. We're hoping that we can somehow tie in different regions. We'll look into connecting the system over 5G, as a potential project through the UBC-Rogers smart campus initiative. However, the overall idea is to make the project accessible to the beekeeper communities all across, so we'll try to use widely accessible devices and sensors.
